# DFS Steps and Algorithm  

### Depth First Search ( DFS ): Procedure

Let's consider the following graph to understand DFS traversal. 

<img src="images/1.jpg" width="60%" alt="image_1"/>

Now we need to generate an input for the code. We can create an adjacency matrix from this graph.

<img src="images/2.jpg" width="60%" alt="image_2"/>

## Step 1:
In this case we can start the traversal from node "0". We need to define a stack to track the nodes.


<img src="images/3.jpg" width="60%" alt="image_3"/>

<ul>
  <li>First put the first node (in this case 0) to the stack. </li>
  <li>Then check if there are any adjacent nodes.</li>
</ul>

## Step 2:

We found 2 adjacent nodes here 1, 2 and 3.
